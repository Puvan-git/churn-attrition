from django.db import models
# This file is where you define your data models. Models in Django map to database tables.
# For example, if you’re storing customer data for churn analysis, you would define a Customer model here.

# If your churn analysis doesn’t rely on a database and instead uses static data 
# (e.g., CSV files), you can leave this file empty.

# Create your models here.
